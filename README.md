musicbrainz docker container
==================

This repo contains everything needed to run a musicbrainz slave server with replication in a docker container.
You will need a little over 20 gigs of free space to run this with replication.

### Configuration
* Set the path where you want to store the downloaded data dumps in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml).
* If you already have data dumps in this path they can be loaded instead of downloading new dumps, see [Create Database](#create-database).
* Set REPLICATION_ACCESS_TOKEN in the [DBDefs.pm file](musicbrainz-dockerfile/DBDefs.pm#L117) to the token you got from musicbrainz (instructions for generating a token are [here](http://blog.musicbrainz.org/2015/05/19/schema-change-release-2015-05-18-including-upgrade-instructions/)).

### Installation

###### Install and Start
* Make sure you have installed docker and docker-compose then:
* `git clone this-repo`
* `cd this-repo`
* `sudo docker-compose up -d`  (On Mac OS X you might want to run this without `sudo`).

### Create database
Create the database, download the latest dumps and populate the database

* `sudo docker-compose run --rm musicbrainz /createdb.sh -fetch`

Create the database, and populate the database with existing dumps

* `sudo docker-compose run --rm musicbrainz /createdb.sh`

### Recreate database
you will need to enter the postgres password that you set in [postgres.env](postgres-dockerfile/postgres.env).
* `sudo docker-compose run -ti --rm musicbrainz /recreatedb.sh`

### Handling Schema Updates
When there is a schema change you will need to follow the directions posted by the musicbrainz team to update the schema.

###### The usual process to update the schema is:

* Ensure you’ve replicated up to the most recent replication packet available with the old schema. (if you’re not sure, run `sudo docker exec musicbrainzdocker_musicbrainz_1 ./admin/replication/LoadReplicationChanges`).
* Switch to the new code with:
* Run bash in the container: `sudo docker exec -ti musicbrainzdocker_musicbrainz_1 bash`.
* Checkout the new branch: `git fetch origin && git checkout NEW_SCHEMA_BRANCH`.
* Run the upgrade script: `./upgrade.sh`.
* Exit bash `exit`.
* Set DB_SCHEMA_SEQUENCE to the NEW_SCHEMA_NUM in the [DBDefs.pm file](musicbrainz-dockerfile/DBDefs.pm#L95)
* `sudo docker-compose stop musicbrainz` then `sudo docker-compose build musicbrainz` then `sudo docker-compose up -d --no-deps musicbrainz`
